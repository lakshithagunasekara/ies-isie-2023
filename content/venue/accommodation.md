Our recommended acommodation options are divided into three categories:

Hotels at the campus or along the metro line in Espoo
Hotels in downtown Helsinki
Low budget accommodation
We have booked capacity from some of the hotels. These capacity bookings expire about 1-1,5 months before the conference. Depending on the hotel, this booked capacity is utilized by following the link or using the code provided in the hotel's introductions below. Please note that the conference organizers cannot guarantee availability of rooms in the hotel. Helsinki and Espoo are very popular in summertime!
