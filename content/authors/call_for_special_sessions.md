### Special Sessions
Special sessions provide the opportunity to focus in detail on emerging topics, which are not reflected in the list of conference main technical tracks or represent a specific working field where researchers would like to meet and discuss advances. Sessions focused on reporting innovations and breakthroughs in highly specialized topic areas (within the conference’s scope) will be organized. These sessions will broaden the knowledge base of attendees, helping them stay updated with recent advances in the industrial electronics domain. The IECON 2024 organizing committee invites professionals in the areas of industrial electronics to propose special sessions (SS)s to be held at IECON 2024.

Once approved, the Organizers will publicize the Special Session among researchers and practitioners in the field and attract sufficient number of papers. Papers submitted to special sessions will undergo the same review process as regular papers. The special session organizers of the respective special session are responsible for organizing the review process, assuring at least three reviews per paper. This includes selection of reviewers from their peers.

### Free Conference Registration
At least one organizer of the successful Special Sessions is expected to register for and attend the conference, as well as chair the corresponding sessions. One complimentary full registration will be provided to successful Special Sessions with at least 6 papers not authored by any of the organizers. 

### Conflict of Interest
Before starting the review process, SS organizers must explicitly declare papers which present a conflict of interest for them. A conflict of interest arises where the judgement of a paper quality can be influenced by the organizers being authors or knowing some of the authors. To ensure independent reviews, this conflict must be marked as such in the submission system and the SS Co-Chairs notified so that they can arrange the review process.

### Restrictions
During the review process, Special Session Organizers must take into account that: 
1. An individual cannot be (co-) author of more than two papers submitted to the same Special Session.
2. Papers from organizers cannot exceed 60% of the contents of the Special Session.

### Session Chairs
When a SS is finally accepted by the conference, SS organizers will serve as Session chairs in the conference. In some extenuated circumstance, Technical Program chairs and Conference General Chairs might take up the full control of appointing the Session Chairs, should the SS organizers be unable to participate in the conference.

### Proposal Content
The special session’s proposal content should include the following information (as mentioned in the MS word template):
1. Title of the Special Session.
2. Brief description of the area of concern (~100 words), with special emphasis on why this is an interesting and significant topic.
3. Name and contact information of 2 to 3 special session organizers (multi-nationals preferred and multi-institutional mandatory), who are willing to promote and organize a sufficient amount of quality submissions to the special session. Please also indicate the background of the organizers.
4. A list of potential authors and their affiliations.
5. A list of potential reviewers and their affiliations (20 minimum).
